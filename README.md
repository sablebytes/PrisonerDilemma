# PrisonerDilemma
This is a project I wrote several years ago back in University, for one of my courses. I had a lot of  run writing it in my language of choice and I feel that it turned out rather fun and elegant.
Copied this over from  my pre-transition github account.

To run, simply run `ruby dilemma.rb` in the terminal with ruby installed.
